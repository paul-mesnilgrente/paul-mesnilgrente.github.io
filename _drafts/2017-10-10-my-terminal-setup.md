I present you in this article what is the configuration of my bash terminal under Ubuntu 16.04.
This starts with the terminal configuration, it continues with the software that I use and it
finishes with my  personal scripts.

# Terminal configuration


# Scripts and Softwares

# My scripts

In a future article, I will show the script that I use to setup all this after a fresh installation.
