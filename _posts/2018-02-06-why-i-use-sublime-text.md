## Markdown Preview

You can use "MarkdownPreview" which is compatible with MathJax. For example, you can type:

```markdown
Inline formula \(x = 2 \times x + 10\) for example

Here is a block formula $$x = 2.x + 10$$
```

And it will render:

Inline formula \\(x = 2 \times x + 10\\) for example

Here is a block formula $$x = 2.x + 10$$
